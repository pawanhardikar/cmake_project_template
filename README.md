# What Am I and why am I special?

  - I am a cookiecutter template and I am here to kickstart your CPP projects. I provide a defined structure on the directories that is usually present in a CPP project.(src/include/test). Then currently I provide build tools like CMake which can be modified/extended based on your specific needs, currently I am fully capable of building a simple cpp project and more functionalities will be added in coming days. I also provide CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins and GitHub Actions) as well. 
  - I consider myself special because there are a lot of cookiecutter templates available in the market for Python,Django, FastAPI, React, Postgre etc. but this I am the **First** one that is available for **CPP**.

## Renovate
- I am using Renovate in my template so all the dependencies will be updated to the latest versions available in the market for public use. I suggest everyone using this template could also use renovate in their projects so that their tools remain updated as well.
  - Steps to use Renovate: 
    - Go to: ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/apps/renovate
    -  Click "Configure"
    - Select your GitHub account/org    
    - You can choose any particular repos in your account or you can select all the repositories in your account.
    - Click "Install"
    - Once done a PR will be created that you can merge to your main branch and then renovate automatically handles the updates and create a PR that you can merge later if you are okay with the updates.
    - These updates can be done to docker base images in your dockerfile(If present).
    - Actions version in GitHub Actions(example: @v2, @v3 etc.)
    - If there's any requirements.txt file it can handle those or any pip files in python projects.


## STATIC CODE ANALYSIS WITH SonarQube:
Static Analysis with SonarQube

This template includes built-in SonarQube support.

To use it:
1. Create a free [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io) or self-hosted SonarQube account
2. Generate a token and save it as `SONAR_TOKEN` in:
      - Steps to generate a token:
        - After signing into your sonarcloud.io. Create an organisation name it according to your convenience.
        - Then go to your profile in top right. Go to Security tab and click on Genrate Tokens by providing any name and the click on generate. Copy the Generated token somewhere safe as you will never find it again.
        - Now use this token to add it in your GitHub secrets and Jenkins credential manager. 
      - Steps to Add a secret in GitHub:
        - Navigate to: Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
        - Click New repository secret
        - Name: SONAR_TOKEN
        - Value: paste the token you copied from SonarCloud
        - Click Add secret
      - Steps to Add a secret in Jenkins:
3. When the CI runs, your code will be analyzed and results will be available on your Sonar dashboard.
